ü•á Security & Encryption::

Security and encryption are critical aspects of WRD API V2. We believe  that protecting user data and ensuring the privacy of our users is paramount.

We also believe in transparency and collaboration, and therefore, any forks of WRD API V2 must also be open-source and accessible to the community. This allows for more developers to contribute and help improve the API's security features.

We strongly discourage any use for malicious purposes. Any such use goes against the values and principles that our API was built upon and is strictly prohibited. We take security very seriously and will take appropriate actions against any malicious actors.

WRD API V2 is built on the principles of collaboration and community involvement. As a project developer & user of our API, it is important that you comply with the wishes of the development team and the community.

This includes adhering to any guidelines or policies set forth by the team, cooperating with other members of the community, and acting in accordance with the spirit of the API and its mission.

- üèÖ Source Handling & Transparency::

Source handling and transparency are also important principles at the heart of WRD API V2. As a user of the API, you must comply with the guidelines of the platform you release your API-powered project on, as well as the API's own rules and policies.

This includes following the terms of use and any other applicable agreements for the platform, as well as ensuring that your project is transparent and open about its use of the API. This includes accurately representing the API and its capabilities in your project, and crediting the API and its contributors appropriately.

By following these principles of source handling and transparency, we can ensure that our solution remains a valuable and trusted resource for developers everywhere. So, please make a move to comply with the rules and guidelines of both the API and the platform where you release your project.
